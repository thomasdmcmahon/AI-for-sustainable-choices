# ðŸŒ± AI-for-sustainable-choices

**AI for Sustainable Choices** is a data-driven tool that helps users measure, track, and reduce their environemental footprnt.
By combining open sustainability datasets with Python, the project translates everyday activities, such as eating, commuting, or using electricity, into **COâ‚‚ emissions, water use, and land footprint**.

âœ¨ The dashboard visualizes personal impact over time and suggests more sustainable alternatives.

## ðŸš€ Features
  - Calculate footprint of **food, transport, and energy usage**
  - Interactive **dashboard** with charts and comparisons
  - Personlized **recommendations** for reducing impact
  - Modular Pytjon enginge (`sustainaCalc`) for custom use
  - Built with open sustainability datasets (Our World in Data, FAO, IPCC)
